        Rise of the Reds – or ROTR for short – improves upon the C&C Generals formula while also adding its own distinct elements to it. Most notably, the mod adds two completely new factions, the tank-heavy Russian Federation and the defence-oriented European Continental Alliance. In addition, the three original factions China, USA and GLA have been greatly expanded and redesigned in a variety of ways, with several new units, buildings, powers and abilities to explore and combine in your in-game tactics. ROTR also changes some of the game mechanics in order to create a unique and fresh experience. Examples include a technology progression system based around three tiers, a more fleshed out counter system between air and anti-air units as well as an additional emphasis on specialised scouting and detection units which serve to make stealth tactics a more viable option than they were in the original game. Beyond the gameplay aspect, the mod also brings many cosmetical updates, spectacular special effects and custom sounds and voice overs to the table.
