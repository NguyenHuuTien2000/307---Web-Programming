                Placeholder content for the <b>Home</b> panel. This one relates to the home tab. Takes you miles high, so high, 'cause she’s got that one international smile. There's a stranger in my bed, there's a pounding in my head. Oh, no. In another life I would make you stay. ‘Cause I, I’m capable of anything. Suiting up for my crowning battle. Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof. Tone, tan fit and ready, turn it up cause its gettin' heavy. Her love is like a drug. I guess that I forgot I had a choice.
